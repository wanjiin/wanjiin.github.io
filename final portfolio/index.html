        <div id="sibling1"></div>
        <div id="reading1"> 
            <i>MAIL ART & THE BIG MONSTER</i>
            <br> my favorite part was by 
            <br> far when Carrion 
            <br> (in his self-awareness) 
            <br> calls himself 'very pretentious' 
            <br> (i laughed out loud) 
        </div>

         <!-- WEEK 3: SCHWULST & U -->
         <div id="sibling2"></div>
         <div id="reading2">
            <i>WEBSITE AS ART FORM</i>
            <br> why is the web being powered by 
            <br> a few, 
            <br> sterile,
            <br> corporations? 
         </div>

         
         <!-- WEEK 4: LUDOVICO & CRAMER -->
         <div id="sibling3"></div>
         <div id="reading3">
            <i>WHEN BOOKS ARE COLLECTOR'S ITEMS</i>
            <br> self-printers and personal book machines
            <br> are funny & shocking & strange
            <br> how will publishing look in the coming years?
            <br> what is the legacy of analog print?
         </div>
         
         <!-- WEEK 6: PRICE -->
         <div id="sibling4"></div>
         <div id="reading4">
            <i>DISPERSION</i>
            <br> can new media artists make art more 
            <br> accessible & interesting with new 
            <br> digital, reproduceable, mass comm networks
            <br> rather than pursue avant-garde ways to 
            <br> highlight the untouchable Bourgeoisie?
         </div>

         <!-- WEEK 5: LIALINA -->
         <div id="sibling5"></div>
         <div id="reading5">
            <i>STILL THERE?</i>
            <br> the web is only thirty years "eternally young"
            <br> but styles are already so fleeting & dated;
            <br> archives like Geocities exist to provide
            <br> the experience of getting old online
         </div>         
         
         <!-- WEEK 8: COKLYAT & FINNEGAN -->
         <div id="sibling6"></div>
         <div id="reading6">
            <i> ALT TEXT </i>
            <br> as another skill
            <br> as another form of art
            <br> as something poetic and universal
            <br> as something uniquely experienced
         </div>     

         <!-- WEEK 9: DUVALL -->
         <div id="sibling7"></div>
         <div id="reading7">
            <i> THE DISNEY LOGO </i>
            <br> design continues to inform itself in a cyclical loop
            <br> in the digital age of hypermodernism, 
            <br> it's interesting to consider how design has become 
            <br> less and less of an architectural tool to signify meaning 
            <br> and has instead become synonymous with meaning...
         </div>    

         <!-- WEEK 12: TUER -->
         <div id="sibling8"></div>
         <div id="reading8">
            <i> BODY MISSING </i>
            <br> contrasting missing bodies with missing art,
            <br> the nonphysical with the physical,
            <br> the message that these bodies only exist 
            <br> in ephemeral evidence and stories
            <br> while stolen artworks still have physical form
         </div>   

         <!-- WEEK 13: SOULELLIS -->
         <div id="sibling9"></div>
         <div id="reading9">
            <i> INFORMATION CULTURE & THE CONSTANT BUZZ </i>
            <br> the post from the feed
            <br> one is an interruption--
            <br> fixed, semantic-based, explicit
            <br> the other is a texture   

         </div>   

         <!-- WEEK 14: BOMANI & BORNO -->
         <div id="sibling10"></div>
         <div id="reading10">
            <i> THE WAY </i>
            <br> cyberspace has a dark history that leaves its marks
            <br> in our modern engagements. tell me, 
            <br> what is a master-slave software?
            <br> what power to words and concepts hold?
            <br> and what implications do they have?
         </div>   

         <!-- WEEK 15: STEYERL -->
         <div id="sibling11"></div>
         <div id="reading11">
            <i> BEAUTY = TRUTH = CORRELATION </i>
            <br> can you prove your humanity by robotically checking a box?
            <br> games are simplified and rational multiverses
            <br> ideal simulations of an illogical reality
            <br> blurring the two can be devastating
